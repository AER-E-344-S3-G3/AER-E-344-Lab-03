In the first part of the lab this week we started by calibrating the pressure sensor and then using that data quantified the uncertainty if the measurements that we collected. The second part of the lab this week, we used the pressure data that we collected in the first part of the lab when calibrating the pressure sensor to create the q-map (The dynamic pressure distribution) inside of test section of the wind tunnel. \url{https://www.aere.iastate.edu/~huhui/teaching/2024-01S/AerE344/lab-instruction/AerE344L-Lab-03-instruction.pdf}
