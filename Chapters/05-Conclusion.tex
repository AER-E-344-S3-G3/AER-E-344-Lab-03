In conclusion to this lab 3, we found that the relationship between the pressure and the voltage was a linear relationship. This then allowed us to assess the uncertainty associated with the measurements that we collected in the lab. This was a vital part of the lab because we then took that data to calculate the dynamic pressure map for the wind tunnel. As a result, we were able to create an illustration of the dynamic pressure distribution within the test section of the wind tunnel. By incorporating the calibrated measurements, we were able to gain valuable insights into the variations in dynamic pressure across different regions of the test section. This approach not only allowed us to visually see how the air flow moves through the test section, but it also allowed us to ensure the accuracy of our experiment.
