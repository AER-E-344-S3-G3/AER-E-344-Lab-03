As part of the Aerodynamics and Propulsion Laboratory, the low-speed wind tunnel at Iowa State University contains pressure sensors to be calibrated. The calibration aims to quantify the uncertainty associated with the calibration constant, denoted as C. This is essential for any following experiments that may involve pressure measurements. Additionally, this will help determine both dynamic pressure and velocity distribution mapping in the wind tunnel. Our results revealed a linear relationship between pressure and voltage.
